**Key Points:**
- Essex County Judge Avion Benjamin ruled that the 20,000-page Latham & Watkins report from 2019 was not privileged information
- Gave the university 30 days to release it
- Quote from Benjamin: "There is a legitimate need for the evidence. The evidence is material and relevant."
- Mark Crawford (SNAP NJ director) quote: "For far too long, survivors and the public have been denied access to information that is essential for truth, accountability, and healing."
- Lawyers in the 450-plaintiff sex abuse lawsuit said they had no idea Reilly and 11 others were implicated until Politico reported it in December
- Last spring, Benjamin ruled that Seton Hall violated discovery orders when it declined to produce all documents relating to the abuse claims
- Board included former New Jersey first lady Mary Pat Christie, who stepped down this summer amid the controversy

**Author:** Dustin Racioppi

**Key Points:**
- Benjamin expressed disbelief earlier this year when attorneys for plaintiffs learned about the 2019 investigation, saying "they had to find out about it in 2025 in POLITICO"
- In March, Benjamin determined that Seton Hall violated a previous court order by not disclosing those documents
- The 2019 report showed that Reilly knew of sexual abuse claims, did not properly report them and was recommended to step down from boards and his leadership position
- John Baldante (attorney for abuse survivors) quote: "Survivors of child sexual abuse are entitled to know what this investigation revealed and what, if anything, Seton Hall and the Archdiocese of Newark did to protect children in response to this investigation."
- Benjamin's order says the documents were part of a factual investigation
- Latham & Watkins specifically said in its report that Seton Hall was not its client, so attorney-client privilege wouldn't apply
- Judge gave the university 30 days to produce the documents to attorneys
