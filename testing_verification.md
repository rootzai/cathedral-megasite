### ✅ COMPLETED TESTS

#### 1. Scrivo Sanctions Section (3x tests)
- **Test 1**: Clicked "A Plea to Judge Benjamin: Sanction Tom Scrivo" - OPENED successfully
- **Test 2**: Clicked again - CLOSED successfully  
- **Test 3**: Clicked again - OPENED successfully
- **Content verified**: 
  - The Double Crime (hiding Latham Report + suing Joe Nyre for leaking it)
  - NJ legal precedent (R. 1:4-8, R. 4:23, multiple cases cited)
  - Bad faith litigation (LoBiondo v. Schwartz)
  - "For the Record" section calling Scrivo a creep
  - "Discovery abuse in cases involving child sexual abuse will not be tolerated"

#### 2. Timeline Corrections in Act III
- **"The Room (August 2019)"** section verified:
  - Describes meeting as "formal proceedings" 
  - "To Masharelli and D'Alessandro, it seemed like a routine board discussion. Formal. Procedural. Subtle."
  - "But Scrivo and Marino understood something the others didn't. They exchanged glances. They spoke in code. They connived on a plan that only they fully grasped."
  - "Masharelli and D'Alessandro were patsies—present but oblivious to the real agenda being set in motion."
  - "The trap was being prepared. But the trigger wouldn't be pulled until February 2020."

- **"January 2020: Reilly's Second Letter"** section verified:
  - Added new section documenting Reilly's second letter to Board
  - "The message was clear: the priests were in revolt, and Joe Nyre had to go."

- **"February 2020: The Cardinal's Decision"** section verified:
  - "On February 27, 2020, Pope Francis appointed Elias Lorenzo as Auxiliary Bishop of Newark. This was the moment Cardinal Tobin had been waiting for."
  - Clear statement: "**This was when the Cardinal made his decision.** Not in August 2019. Not in some vague 'room meeting.' In February 2020, after Reilly's second task force letter and Lorenzo's appointment to auxiliary bishop, Cardinal Tobin decided Joe Nyre had to go."

#### 3. Board Risk Committee Content
- Verified in "What the Documents Will Reveal" section:
  - "Board Risk Committee minutes proving that everyone in leadership knew the Cardinal was compromised"
  - "The Board of Regents discussed the question explicitly: 'If the Cardinal is caught, do we go adverse to the Archdiocese of Newark?' Their answer: Yes."
  - "Marino's Leverage" subsection explaining how Marino controlled Tobin
